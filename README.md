# PasswordGen

A low-resource password generator to run locally on your computer.
## For the privacy minded:
This program does not and will not ever save generated passwords.
This program does not and will not ever connect to the internet.
Passwords are generated with the standard library functions for random 
number generation. This means the pseudorandom generator is as secure as 
the programming language's implementation.
